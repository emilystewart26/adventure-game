            You are in a band and it's your dream to play the Pyramid Stage. Unfortuntely the promoters don't think you're good enough yet... You must battle with other guitarists at the festival to prove your worth and leave the promoters no choice but to put you on the bill! <br><br>
            You are currently at the Pyramid Stage. You see a large sign that says "bar" above a massive circus-style tent, and to the left, music from the Other Stage is drifting across. <br><br>
